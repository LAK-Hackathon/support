# Learning Analytics Hackathon Resources

This page lists data and code that might be helpful in you hackathon.

## Data Sets

### Open University Learning Analytics dataset

An anonymised dataset containing  data about courses, students and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven selected courses (called modules)

## Data Standards

### General Learning Analtytics Standards

Both xAPI and Caliper provide ways of representing learning experiences in a standard way:

xAPI - [https://experienceapi.com/overview/](https://experienceapi.com/overview/) .

Caliper - [https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper)

### Other Learning Analtytics Standards

Jisc Universal Data Definitions - a standard way of describing students, their courses and results, used in Jisc's National Learning Analytics Architecture.

Jisc Universal xAPI Recipies and Templates - xAPI recipies and templates used by Jisc's National Learning Analytics Architecture, covering VLE, Attendance, Library and others.

## Code Tools

### LakHak Test Data

an output from the 2017 Hackathon - this code generates test activity data relating to VLEs, used to create visualisations.

## Code Libraries

### Highcharts

An easy to use Javascript charting library - great for getting started with standard charts.

### d3

A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.  If you want to created new types of visualisations consider this.  The learning curve is higher than something like Highcharts, but it is far more flexible.

## Code Examples

### Pulling xaPI and UDD data from Learning Locker

This shows how to pull bulk data from Jisc's learning data hub, and includes a small amount of test data.
